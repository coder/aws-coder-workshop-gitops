# 🚀 Prototype Anything with AI – Coder Template 

This template lets you quickly prototype *anything* using Claude Code inside a Coder workspace. Just tell Claude what you want to build, and it will generate code, run a dev server, and show a live preview—all automatically.

## ✍️ How to use

1. Create a **new workspace** using the **“Prototype Anything with AI”** template.
2. Fill out:
   - **Workspace Name** → (use a name or accept the suggestion)
   - **AI Prompt** → describe what you want Claude Code to build.
3. Click **Create Workspace**.

🎉 That’s it! Your workspace will launch, and Claude Code will start building.

## 💡 Prompt examples

✅ “Build a simple hello world website.”  
✅ “Create an online sock store app with a product page”  
✅ “Make a website celebrating upcoming holidays with a festive design.”

You can also leave the prompt blank—Claude Code will ask you what to build after the workspace launches.

Your app will run on **port 3000** (accessible via Coder’s preview link). You can send additional instructions inside the workspace terminal to keep improving your project.
